# Apartments.com Web Scrapping Tool


Using Python to web Scrap all the apartments data from a region.
Then it is easier to use the data for further analyse. 

Example used case: 

When looking for a new apartment to lease, I web scrapped all the data in Python. With the data in my program, I then have the freedom to further sort the apartments list by Built Years, Rent Prices, Availabilities, Websites, Hours, Phone Numbers ... etc.

The biggest advantage is that I can make then marks on apartments if I have visited their websites, contacted, or have gone on a physical tour. Heck, I can even rate the apartments in different aspects and sort them, filter them, play around with them in any way I want! 

This completely regain you the control of the Apartments data from the overwhelming, unorganized interface from Apartments.com, but uses its data service to the fullest.
