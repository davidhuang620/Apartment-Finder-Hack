# Apartments.com Web Scrapping Tool

Version: 5/31/2018


Using Python to web Scrap all the apartments data in a region from Apartments.com.
Then it is easier to use the data for further analysis. 


An example use case: 

When looking for a new apartment to lease, I web scrapped all the data in Python. With all the apartments data in my program, I then have the freedom to further sort and filter the apartment list by "Built Years", "Rent Prices", "Availabilities", "Websites", "Hours", "Phone Numbers" ... etc.

The biggest advantage, is that I can make marks on apartments if I have visited their websites, or contacted them, or have gone on a physical tour, or any kinds of note I want to make ... etc.  Heck, I can even rate apartments in different aspects and sort them, filter them, play around with them in any way I want! Eventually come up with a smaller lists of apartments, and find the next perfect home.

This Web Scrapping Tool completely regain you the control of the Apartments data from the overwhelming, unorganized interface from Apartments.com, but uses its data service to the fullest.
